<h1 >Daunku </h1>
<p>Welcome to the "Portfolio" repository. This is a coded version of a previously designed interface design.</p>

<h3>Only with HTML, Tailwind CSS and JS technology.</h3>
<p>In this project, I only used HTML, TailwindCSS and JS technologies. The reason I use TailwindCSS is that it conforms to the pixel-perfect design approach and feels more free. If you haven't used Tailwind before, I would definitely recommend using it with preitter.</p>

<h3>View and browse the design freely with the demo.</h3>
<p>I will share the demo link to see the design and browse comfortably. <a href="https://daunku.vercel.app/" target="_blank">You can click me to see the demo.</a></p>
